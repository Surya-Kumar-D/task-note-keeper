Summary:-

1. First i read the assignment docs and i understood the requirements.

2. Then i checked the google keep to see the functionalities and i understood the basics of it.

3. Then i started the project with the tech stack of nextjs, tailwindcss, daisyui, zod, prisma, react-hot-toast, lucide-react.

4. For the first development i used the daisy ui components and the zod schema to validate the data.

5. For the backend storage of notes i used prisma and neonDb to store the data as i have not worked with google cloud.

6. For every error or success of a functionality will be notified by the react-hot-toast.

7. For the pagination of the note i tried multiple things but learned about searchParams in the next js and used it to communicate between pagination component and the main page.

8. I have also implemented dark moe and light mode with the toggle using the remote state management(context api of react).

9. For Icons on the page i used the lucide-react with the daisy ui loading spinner.

10. When clicked ont the note, the modal will be opened and the user can update, delete or pin the note.

- For the things i don't know or haven't tried i got help from the chatgpt and claude ai.

- Thanks for giving me a chance to learn and grow!
